```
apollo-server-micro + typescript + prisma-nexus => ⚡️
```

Some random awesome project made with `apollo-server-micro` with Typescript feat. `nexus` & `prisma`.

## Development

### With `docker-compose`

Install [DockStation](https://dockstation.io/) for running docker compose. Trust me, it's easier to manage the whole thing.

Alternatively, you can still use cli to run `docker-compose` (Instruction to be added)..

### With `micro-dev` (temp)

You can run this locally with `yarn dev`, but still need to run Docker locally to host prisma.

## Deployment

> To be finalized since prisma is a bit tricky to deploy..
